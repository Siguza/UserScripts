  Breaks [FuckAdBlock](https://github.com/sitexw/FuckAdBlock).
* `Slim-MOXiI-Forum.user.js`  
  Makes the [MOXiI Forum](http://www.newosxbook.com/forum/index.php) less wide.
* `SZS-Plus.user.js`  
  Various improvements to [an old German browser game](http://szs.looki.de/).
* `WhatsCrapp.user.js`  
  Hides annoying stuff on WhatsApp Web.
